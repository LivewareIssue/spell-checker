On a cold day in April of 1984, a man named Winston Smith returns to his home, a dilapidated apartment building called
Victory Mansions. Thin, fral, and thirty-nine years old, it is painful for him to trudge up the stairs because he has a
varicose ulcer above his right ankle. The elevator is always out of service so he does not try to use it. As he climbs
the staircase, he is greeted on each landing by a poster depicting an enormous face, underscored by the words
“BIG BROTHER IS WATHING YOU.”
